    <p>For the 2018 FRC season, I was part of the team in charge of the code architecture of the robot.  Our team wanted to
      make sure that our architecture was especially safe and good at error handling so that our robot would not crash during
      the competition game. This was an issue in our pre-season competition, where our robot sometimes didn’t run at all
      during the match due to the robot not detecting our Jetson or other issues. </p>
    <p>In previous years, we had used the same general architecture, with the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Robot: contains all objects, and the code for autonomous and teleop modes</li>
      <li>RobotMap: contains the mapping of motors and sensors</li>
      <li>SensorThread: continuously updates and records values from sensors</li>
      <li>OI: contains code for controls/joysticks</li>
      <li>Database: contains important numbers and retrieving sensor data</li>
      <li>Subsystems: representations of independently controlled parts (arms, drivetrain, shooter)</li>
      <li>Commands: actions of subsystems</li> </ul>
    <p>We wanted to keep the general architecture, but write new classes to support more logging and error handling. Here are
      the new classes that we wrote:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TrackingRobot: more logging, try-catch around functions, a new thread for Jetson</li>
      <li>TrackableSubsystem: logging, getting state of subsystems, and function to run code after stopping</li>
      <li>Devices: contains all hardware devices on robot</li>
      <li>Controls: replaces OI to avoid RobotBase error</li>
      <li>UtilityServerSocket: socket used to connect to Jetson server</li> </ul>
    <p>We had to give a presentation to the other members of the software team about it so that they could implement their
      features with little difficulty.</p>

    <p>After our work in architecture, we also worked on robot diagnostic code. With this project, we wanted to diagnose
      each device of the robot to ensure that the robot is functioning well before games. We would run the diagnostic code
      before each round to ensure motors, sensors, and other components are working. If there are any problems, we can
      quickly fix them before the match, and not be surprised during the match.</p>
    <p>This project was fairly simple, as we only had to create a list of things on the robot (ie. how many talons/gyro/etc.),
      and test each item on the list. We were able to complete the diagnostic code, with lots of logging on the status of
      each component, and it was used heavily during competitions between matches.</p>
