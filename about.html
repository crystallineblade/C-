      <div class="text">Hi! I'm a current student at Carnegie Mellon studying
        artificial intelligence and psychology. I'm from the Bay Area, and when
        I'm not busy in class or working, I enjoy playing video games, trying new
        foods, and playing music. I also like listening to musical theatre and
        hanging out with my bunny. <br> <br>
        My love for computer science stems from my childhood playing video games.
        As a young child, I only knew that I could play games with my siblings on
        the computer. This hobby became the core of many friendships, from the
        neighbors my age and friends at school. I felt that video games contributed
        so much to the happiness in my life, and when I learned that people
        programmed to make video games, I was inspired to pursue computer science
        to bring other people that same happiness. Although I was somewhat naive
        and didn't totally get hooked onto programming, video games was the first
        stepping stone in my path toward computer science. <br> <br>
        The second stone came from my time in my high school's FRC robotics team.
        Although I was younger than the other members and was still taking our
        school's APCS class, I was eager to join the team under my teacher's
        recommendation. Making robots just sounded cool, and I wanted to be a
        part of that. I was shy and didn't contribute very much at the beginning,
        but I learned to be proactive and dedicate lots of effort to help my team
        succeed. Robotics helped show me the multitude of uses for computer science,
        from neural networks to computing the robot's path, and pushed me to study
        artificial intelligence. <br> <br>
        I was inspired to pursue psychology after looking at the widespread
        emotional and mental health issues with my peers. I personally dealt
        with some problems with depression and gender dysphoria, and I worried
        about other friends that stressed from family, school, or social situations.
        I was also shy and introverted, and I wondered why I couldn't be like
        other people and have an easier time socializing. I wanted to learn what
        makes people tick and how we develop our personalities, so that maybe I
        could change myself. In Carnegie Mellon, I also found the connections
        between artificial intelligence, and wondered how we can use psychology
        to understand more about AI, and vice versa. <br> <br>
        My resume experiences may look messy and unfocused, but they all help
        build me up as a person. From my part-time jobs, it became easier to talk
        publicly, and I learned management and customer service skills, as well
        as having good work ethic. I was also able to save money for my family,
        self-care, and world experiences. My tutoring jobs and clubs allowed me
        to pass my knowledge to others, and allow me to help others learn so that
        they may be inspired to do great things. I still wanted to contribute to
        my love for video games in some ways, even if I decided it was not the
        right choice for my career. <br> <br>
        In the near future, I wish to contribute to or even lead the development
        of some majorly life-changing technologies. I particularly want to work
        towards superintelligent computers that can act and live like a human,
        but I am excited to work on anything, from a fascinating video game to
        life-saving medical robots. Nevertheless, I want to bring about happiness
        to the world and leave a brighter future for later generations.
